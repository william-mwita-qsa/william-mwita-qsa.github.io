## 🧠 PROFESSIONAL PROFILE  
Quantitative Systems Analyst specializing in **FinTech Analytics, Risk Intelligence, and Bayesian Modeling**.  
I build predictive systems that combine mathematical precision with behavioral insight to solve complex financial and human-centered problems.

With a strong foundation in statistics, computing, and systems thinking, I design intelligent decision models, credit scoring tools, and data pipelines for financial institutions and customer experience systems.  
Currently building a professional portfolio on GitHub and exploring opportunities to bring structure, logic, and emotional intelligence into Africa’s FinTech space through data-driven strategies.
